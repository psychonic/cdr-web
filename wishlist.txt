- keep cdr_id when viewing subs (for now it just shows the current sub associations)

- resolve app names for the view pages
- resolve names for correct CDR on CDR View page

- do diffs on user_defined

- figure out the true date on the cdr

- search on fields not in index need to be appended to table (virtual fields)
- searching on key value fields, both key value pair and all values

- cleanup all the $this->set in controllers

- pretty format for cdr view

- save view state for app/sub history when paginating

- CDRUpdater: select fields in order we expect, then output in MySQL order (sanity)
